    # Will check against files that should be ignored by brunch compiler, but are
    # still watched by the watcher. For example, when you have common.styl file that
    # you import in every stylus file, common.styl will be compiled on its own too
    # which will result in duplicated code. When prefixing it with underscore
    # (_common.styl) you are still able to import it in dependent files, but it wonâ€™t
    # be compiled twice. The feature is very similar to Sass partials. By default,
    # files and directories that start with underscore (_) will be ignored, as well as
    # anything under the vendor/node/, vendor/ruby-*/, vendor/jruby-*/, and
    # vendor/bundle/ directories.

    # ignored: false

    # DON'T COPY `assets` DIR
    # Default value: /assets[\\/]/. If test gives true, file won't be compiled
    # and will be just moved to public directory instead.

    assets: []

    # If test gives true, file won't be wrapped in module, if there are any.
