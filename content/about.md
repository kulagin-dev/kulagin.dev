# About

Hello! My name is Ivan, and I'am backend developer since 1998. This site's
primary purpose is to demonstrate my skills in different technologies,
especially in my current favorites: Ruby language, RoR and BDD. Please read my
full story to get the first impressions.

## The way I work

- I'm a huge fan of TDD/BDD and particulary Rspec
- Use SOLID, KISS and DRY (amoung others) principles and don't overengineer using them
- Always trying to be smart and accurate while refactoring, start it only after I have tests covered refactoring zone (if this is my code, it's always true) and find a compromise between complexity and readabi-ty
- Break large tasks onto small ones, it it's still complex, repeat
- I be-eve that modern developer must learn something new every day, especially in our information century, to be on the edge of new ideas and technologies
- Love to read the source code if it's readable, of course
- Write clean code and find simple and elegant solutions using language-specific technics
- Learn fast (thanks to 16 years of experience)
- RTFC, RTFM and google in every unexpected situation
- Keep my workspace and tools simple and responsive, so they don't bother me, allowing me to fully concentrate on current task
