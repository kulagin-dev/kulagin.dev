You’ll get started right away with RSpec 2 and Cucumber by developing a simple
game, using Cucumber to express high-level requirements in language your
customer understands, and RSpec to express more granular requirements that focus
on the behavior of individual objects in the system. You’ll learn how to use
test doubles (mocks and stubs) to control the environment and focus the RSpec
examples on one object at a time, and how to customize RSpec to “speak” in the
language of your domain.

You’ll develop Rails 3 applications and use companion tools such as Webrat and
Selenium to express requirements for web applications both in memory and in the
browser. And you’ll learn to specify Rails views, controllers, and models, each
in complete isolation from the other.

Whether you’re developing applications, frameworks, or the libraries that power
them, The RSpec Book will help you write better code, better tests, and deliver
better software to happier users.
