Almost completely rewritten backend (Ruby on Rails based) ugly source code,
added completely missed integration/unit specs, added Mercury Editor for admins,
no frontend work applied (client is waiting for new design), removed or taken from gems 90% of code (JS mostly).

Results of refactoring:

```
3,626,024 bytes -> 322,949 bytes
536 files changed
5562 insertions(+)
98880 deletions(-)
```

Less code - less trouble :)
