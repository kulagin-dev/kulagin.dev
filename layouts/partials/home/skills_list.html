<h3>Languages</h3>

<p>This group of languages I know very vell (some of them I don't use anymore, though)</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Ruby</strong> - today is my primary language I use since 2011, and feel myself very comportable with it.
    For a few last years there are rumors what Ruby is dying, but trust me - it's allright with language, there's a problem on how pepople use it.
    I'm about monkey-patching, God classes and other bad practicies.
    Ruby gives a lot of freedom, and because of that requires a lot of developer's responsibility.
    That's why principles such as SOLID, works so good for Ruby - they prevent developers from wrong language using (take
    a look at my favorite examples - <a href="http://hanamirb.org/" target="_blank">Hanami framework</a>
    or <a href="http://dry-rb.org/" target="_blank">DRY* gems family</a>).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>*sh</strong> - every developer must feel comfortable with at least one of them, and knowing their different tricks and edge-cases.
    *sh itself not very hard to learn.
    Much more important to learn common tools provided by *nix and tasks they allow to complete.
  </li>
  <li>

    <strong>PHP</strong> - I don't use PHP anymore, but this was my primary language for more that 10 years.
    I stopped using it when PHP began to demonstrate features of solid language like namepsaces, but that was too late for me.
  </li>
  <li>

    <strong>C#</strong> - I don't use it anymore, but that was a great experience, and I believe it will help me with Java
  </li>
  <li>

    <strong>PL/pgSQL</strong> - I love it! Actually it's my first declarative language I started to learn, looks a bit clumsy, but feels so powerful. Threre wasn't much tasks there I could learn it more, but every time it's an interesting experience.
  </li>
  <li>

    <strong>Lua</strong> - using for creating custom <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ConTeXt"
                                                        target="_blank">ConTeXt</a> writers for <a
      href="http://pandoc.org/README.html" target="_blank">Pandoc</a> (I love parsers and books! :).
    Easy to learn, have unusual RegExp engine, and not much popular...

  </li>
</ul>

<p>The languages below I'm currenlty learning one by one. As soon as my knowlege and practical using of them will be enought, I will move them to the upper list.</p>

<ul>

  <li>
    <strong>Elixir/Phoenix</strong> - this is what I'm curently actively learning, and I love it!
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Elm</strong> - crazy thing, but looks so sexy to me. Quick touch give some nice results, but I just don't
    need frontend lang right now.
  </li>
  <li>

    <strong>Java</strong> - though I have some experience with Java many years ago (before C# came into scene), I realized what since then Java world changed a lot.
    Practically speaking I'm learning Java from the start, but thanks to C# experiance this process is quite fast.
    One of the main goals I have - developing Android apps
  </li>
  <li>

    <strong>Clojure/ClojureScript</strong> - this is the next language I plan to learn. Maybe before/after Elm, it depends on how things will go.
    There are tree reasons: get functional, ClojureScript as fronted lang and Elisp.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3> Ruby gems</h3>

<p>
  It's easier to list only major ones: Rack (hello, <a href="https://github.com/elixir-plug/plug"
                                                       target="_blank">Plug</a> :) ) Rails, Grape, Hanami, DRY* gems family, Statemachines (any), Devise/Warden,
  Pundit/Protector/Cancancan, OmniAuth, PDF generation gems, Capistrano, Sidekiq/SuckerPunch, RSpec, Webmock, VCR, Capybara, tons of them...
</p>

<h3> Databases</h3>

<ul>

  <li>

    <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> - this is my favorite RDBMS since I begin to use Rails.
    My experience include: all the common stuff, administration/migration, triggers, rules, functions, materialized views, table patitioning, PL/pgPSQL, extensions like cube, uuid-ossp, hstore and so on.
    I'm not a PostgreSQL guru, but it's always interesting for me to learn something new about it.
  </li>
  <li>

    <strong>MySQL</strong> - I do not use that one for years, but used since 1998.
    In other words I'm not interested in MySQL after I met PostgreSQL.
  </li>
  <li>

    <strong>Redis</strong> - I began to use it in my own project when the trend of NoSQL started back to year 2010 (approx).
  </li>
  <li>

    <strong>MongoDB</strong> - I began to use it at the same time as Redis within the same project
  </li>
  <li>

    <strong>Elasticsearch</strong> - never used, but actually this is my next DB to learn, I believe that will be very interesting
  </li>
</ul>

<h3> API's integration</h3>

<ul>

  <li>

    <a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/"

  </li>
  <li>

    <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/"
       target="_blank"><strong>Firebase Authentication</strong></a> - used this one for authentication for a client with API project. I needed some additional features, so I created custom
    <a href="https://github.com/hassox/warden"
       target="_blank">Warden</a> strategy to handle JWT authentication. Also I've added Firebase Authentication to Android app prototype for the same project (Java).
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>

    <a href="https://www.twilio.com/"
       target="_blank"><strong>Twilio</strong></a> - this API I learned very well since I was responsible to refactor complex communication part of recent project.
  </li>
  <li>

    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wallet/"
       target="_blank"><strong>Apple Passbook API</strong></a> (Web, Pushes and Pass format itself). I used all of these while creating
    <a href="/works/#bestfit" target="_blank">this</a> app.
  </li>
  <li>

    <a href="https://slack.com/"
       target="_blank"><strong>Slack</strong></a> - easy integration, nothing interesting: fancy bot messages with images and so on
  </li>
  <li>

    <a href="https://rollbar.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Rollbar</strong></a> - error tracking service

       target="_blank"><strong>AcoustID</strong></a> - service providing search in music database by audio fingerprints
  </li>
  <li>

    <a href="https://wiki.musicbrainz.org/Development/JSON_Web_Service"
       target="_blank"><strong>MusicBrainz</strong></a> - huge music database you can search against
  </li>
  <li>

    <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Cover_Art_Archive/API"
       target="_blank"><strong>Cover Art Archive</strong></a> - found track name? use this API to get vinyl cover image :)
  </li>
  <li>

    <a href="https://airbrake.io/"
       target="_blank"><strong>Airbrake</strong></a> - very useful, but overpriced, service for tracking runtime errors
  </li>
  <li>

</ul>


<h3> DevOps</h3>

<ul>

  <li><strong>Tools</strong>

    <ul>

      <li><a href="https://www.ansible.com/"
             target="_blank"><strong>Ansible</strong></a> - this perl is my &num;1 tool if I'm working on DevOps. It (or to be more specific one of it's galaxy's
        <a href="https://github.com/ansistrano/deploy" target="_blank">Ansistrano</a> role) even replaced me <a
            href="http://capistranorb.com/" target="_blank">Capistrano</a> which was my favorite deploy tool for years.
      </li>

      <li><a href="http://capistranorb.com/"
             target="_blank"><strong>Capistrano</strong></a> - yup, Ruby's deploy workhorse. This was no-choice option for deploy for me for years (yes, I heard about
        <a href="https://github.com/mina-deploy/mina"
           target="_blank">Mina</a>, but there's no sense to use it when you have Ansible now)
      </li>
      <li><a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/"
             target="_blank"><strong>Vagrant</strong></a> - any fancy multi-machine configuration (very useful for networking prototyping). Paired with Ansible provisioning, these two form a very powerful tool.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Services</strong>
    <ul>

      <li><strong>Amazon EC2</strong>
      </li>

      </li>
      <li><strong>Amazon RDS</strong>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Amazon SES</strong> (including DNS configuration)
      </li>
      <li><strong>Amazon Elastic Beanstalk</strong>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Amazon EC2 Containers</strong> (learning)
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p> I have a little experience with Heroku, but none of my clients actually used it. Anyway, that should not be a trouble.</p>

<h3> Operating systems</h3>

<ul>

  <li>

    <strong>OS X</strong> - my primary every-day OS
  </li>
  <li>

    <strong>Debian family</strong> - my previous main OS (ubuntu particulary). Now I'm using it for deployment/containers
  </li>
  <li>

    <strong>FreeBSD</strong> - my favorite server OS I use for my own dedicated server
  </li>
  <li>

    <strong>ArchLinux/Gentoo</strong> - 'cause it's fun and healthy for brain :)
  </li>
  <li>

    <strong>Windows</strong> - games only, nothing interesting there
  </li>
</ul>

<h3> Front end</h3>

<p>

  <strong>There's a lot of frontend tools I use, but I use them for my personal projects, and not looking for frontend related job. Quick fixes, nothing more. So this section I'll keep empty</strong>
</p>
