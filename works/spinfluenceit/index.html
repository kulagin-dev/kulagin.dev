As a free bonus we&rsquo;ve got a <strong>swagger docs</strong> for API for free. <strong>Hanami</strong> (formerly Lotusrb)wasn&rsquo;t mature enough yet, but today I&rsquo;d definitely use it instead (or even clean Rack app), additionally replacing ActiveRecord which I consider as an antipattern for everything but MVP.</p><p>Interesting design decisions/stack used:</p><ul><li><strong>Firebase for authentication</strong></li><li><strong>Google Cloud Messaging</strong> to interact with guest&rsquo;s mobile application (broadcasts, direct messages)</li><li>heavy use of bz2 streams to transfer huge DJ&rsquo;s music collection metadata</li><li>stream compressed metadata in <strong>NDJSON</strong> format</li><li>PG per-DJ partitioning (at those times there wasn&rsquo;t native PG solution for that out of the box)</li><li>multiple external musical APIs integration (cover images look up, search song my fingerprint etc). At some point each background track normalization process called 5 different external APIs</li><li>of course most core features where covered by tests (unit/feature al kind of, depending on what was the goal of tests)</li><li>custom <strong>Firebase authentication</strong> <code>warden</code> strategies implemented for both roles: DJ and Guest</li><li>few PG triggers implemented on <strong>PL/pgSQL</strong> to ease work with millions of music tracks data records</li><li><strong>Braintree</strong> payments integration</li><li>using <strong><a href=https://github.com/que-rb/que>Que</a></strong> for background tasks (client want no additional elements like Redis in stack)</li><li>simple <strong>S3 integration</strong></li></ul><p>This was a very interesting experience, where I had to use all my knowledge about performance optimization and big project (with lots of data) leading development</p><a class="mdl-button mdl-js-button mdl-button--raised mdl-js-ripple-effect mdl-button--accent" href=https://spinfluenceit.com/ target=_blank>Visit</a></div>
